Organize your week by setting recurring and special events in place and let it notify you of them while it runs in the background!

**THIS PROJECT IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS.**

## Installation

Currently there is only a windows version of the program.

Download the .exe file from the newest release and put it in its own folder, as it automatically creates a .json file in the directory it's in to store the schedule data.
